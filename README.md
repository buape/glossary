# Glossary

This repository holds the translation glossary used across projects, and is used at https://translate.buape.com

We have this to standardize translations for terms across strings for common phrases, as well as listing "translations" for phrases and terms that should not be translated, such as branding.

All languages have their own glossary file within the `/languages` directory.
